# Pokémon Multi-Label Classification

This project applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify Pokémon sprites into multiple labels simultaneously (types, stats, etc.).  
The model was trained using custom datasets and fine-tuned with different hyperparameters to optimize performance.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Project Structure
- `multlbl.ipynb`: Main notebook containing data preprocessing, model building, training and evaluation.
- `Pokemon.csv`: Dataset used for training.
- `pokemon/`: Folder with sprite images used for model input.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries: TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
3. Open and run `multlbl.ipynb` sequentially.
